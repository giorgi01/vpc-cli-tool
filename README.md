# VPC CLI Tool

This Python script provides a command-line interface (CLI) program that helps with managing Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) in AWS. The script utilizes the `argparse` library for command-line argument parsing and the `boto3` library to interact with the AWS EC2 service. The script allows you to create a VPC, create an Internet Gateway (IGW), and attach the IGW to a VPC.

## Prerequisites

Before using this script, make sure you have the following:

- Python installed on your system
- AWS credentials properly configured for programmatic access

## Installation

To use the script, follow these steps:

1. Install the required Python libraries by running the following command:

    ```bash
    pip install boto3
    pip install botocore
2. Save the script to a file, for example, main.py.
## Usage
Run the script with the desired command and arguments to perform specific actions related to VPC management.
  
    python main.py [command] [options]

### Commands
The script supports the following commands:
vpc: Create a new VPC.
igw: Create a new Internet Gateway.
attach: Attach an existing IGW to an existing VPC.

### Options
The script accepts the following options:

- --vpc_name: Name of the VPC (required for the vpc command).
- --igw_name: Name of the Internet Gateway (required for the igw command).
- --vpc_id: ID of the VPC (required for the attach command).
- --igw_id: ID of the Internet Gateway (required for the attach command).

## Examples
### Create a VPC
To create a new VPC, use the vpc command along with the --vpc_name option:

    python main.py vpc --vpc_name my-vpc

This will create a new VPC with the specified name.

### Create an Internet Gateway
To create a new Internet Gateway, use the igw command along with the --igw_name option:

    python main.py igw --igw_name my-igw
This will create a new Internet Gateway with the specified name.

### Attach an Internet Gateway to a VPC
To attach an existing Internet Gateway to an existing VPC, use the attach command along with the --vpc_id and --igw_id options:

    python main.py attach --vpc_id vpc-12345678 --igw_id igw-12345678
This will attach the specified Internet Gateway to the specified VPC.

## AWS Credentials
This tool uses AWS credentials to interact with the AWS EC2 service. By default, it uses environment variables to retrieve the credentials. Ensure that the following environment variables are set:

- aws_access_key_id: AWS access key ID.
- aws_secret_access_key: AWS secret access key.
- aws_session_token (optional): AWS session token (if using temporary credentials).
- aws_region_name: AWS region where the VPC and IGW should be created.
